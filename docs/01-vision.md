# Vision

Most retail POS systems store current state (stock, balance),
but cannot reconstruct the real history of what happened.

REXIRA is designed as a transactional system based on real-world events.

Goals:
- Inventory traceability by batch
- Separation between sale and payment
- Auditable historical reconstruction
- Financial consistency
